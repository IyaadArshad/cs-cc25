Beijing: Amid the ongoing tariff war between China and the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China "is not afraid of provocations, and it won't back down."

Mao Ning shared a video of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953 during its war with the US. While sharing the video on X, Mao Ning stated, "We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don't back down."

In the video posted on X, Zedong said, "As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide," he says. "It used to depend on President Truman, and it will depend on President Eisenhower, or whoever becomes the next US president. It's up to them."

"No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We'll fight until we completely triumph," he added.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) announced an immediate increase in tariffs on China to 125 per cent. The move by the US President came following a retaliatory move by China, where it increased its tariff on US goods from 34 per cent to 84 per cent starting April 10.

China announced that it would increase its tariff on US goods from 34 per cent to 84 per cent starting April 10, as reported by Al Jazeera. The decision came after the US increased tariffs on China to a whopping 104 per cent.

Earlier on Sunday, Trump threatened an additional 50 per cent hike in tariffs on China following Beijing's 34 per cent retaliatory tariff hike after the US President's announcement of reciprocal tariffs during Liberation Day on April 2.

China decried the US tariffs imposed on the country as "groundless" and called them a unilateral bullying practice, as per a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Commerce.

Cultural similarities and building personal relationships drive dynamic synergy

Mumbai: The growing India-UAE partnership, particularly through the key economic hubs of Mumbai and Dubai, is reshaping the business landscape and presenting immense opportunities across diverse sectors, top officials said.

The Dubai-India Business Forum, held in Mumbai on Tuesday, gathered 200 industry leaders, including about 40 who flew in from Dubai. R Mukundan, Vice President of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), livened up the discussions by highlighting the crucial importance of the twin cities in global business.

“The power of India and the power of the UAE, and Dubai and Bombay [the old name for Mumbai], is so strong that an American colleague came here, landed at my office, and said: ‘Now I realise, if you are not in Dubai or Mumbai, it’s goodbye.’ So, that tells you the huge power of what these two countries, in combination, can do,” Mukundan said, to cheers and applause from the audience at the forum organised on the sidelines of the visit of Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, to India.

Mukundan pointed out that the cultural similarities between India and the UAE, coupled with their shared ambition to act swiftly while building and valuing deep personal relationships, are the driving forces behind this dynamic synergy.

“India offers immense potential, as well as all the strengths Dubai has.”

Mukundan noted that with India pivoting toward digitalisation and sustainability, Dubai’s experience, especially in areas like fintech, creates fertile ground for mutual growth.

“Dubai is the way the entire world wants to be in the future,” he said, earning another round of applause.
Robust strategy

Mohammad Ali Rashid Lootah, President and CEO of Dubai Chambers, said that Dubai is an ideal platform for startups, with events like Expand North Star attracting the largest number of startups from India.

“We had more than 300 startups coming from India. This has never happened, even with Silicon Valley or other places. Now, India is considered the third-largest producer of unicorns. This shows the very robust strategy India has in place.”

Lootah highlighted how Dubai has transformed itself into a business hub, not only for the Middle East but for Africa as well.
Tip of the iceberg

Adeeb Ahamed, Chair of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FICCI) Middle East Council, highlighted the deep cultural and business ties between the two countries.

“A large part of the fabric of Indian and UAE businesses, especially in Dubai, shares the same pattern – mostly family-owned, family-run businesses,” he said, explaining the shared values that underpin the thriving economies. The UAE is increasingly becoming a springboard for Indian companies to tap into international investments, while UAE-based companies are keen to expand into India’s diverse markets.

“I think we are only touching the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot more interaction necessary to involve more first-generation and second-generation companies, to understand each other's strengths and how we could invite more FDI into India and leverage those investments to make the UAE a knowledge-led hub of the future as well,” Ahamed added.

Meanwhile, Anant Singhania, past President and current Managing Committee Member of the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry, underscored the role of innovation in the relationship. Dubai’s vision, such as building Ski Dubai in the middle of a desert, and India’s vast pool of skilled professionals and robust systems, he noted, create a complementary synergy, and could be the key to a progressive future.

Dubai: Emirates Airline, a key symbol of the UAE’s robust ties with India, has carried more than 90 million passengers between Dubai and India since it began operations in 1985.

This was revealed amid the first official India visit by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Defence of the UAE and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, which concluded on Wednesday.

Emirates currently operates 167 weekly flights, connecting Dubai to nine Indian cities, according to the Government of Dubai Media Office (DMO). This milestone reflects the growing significance of the India-Dubai air corridor, with Emirates playing a pivotal role in enhancing connectivity between the two nations.
Another step forward

Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, Chairman of Dubai Airports, and Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline and Group, who accompanied Sheikh Hamdan during his official visit to India, highlighted the airline’s long-standing relationship with the country.

Writing on social media platform X, Sheikh Ahmed said: “India was one of @Emirates' very first destinations, serving over 90 million passengers across 40 years of operation. This visit marks another step forward in the mutual vision for growth and innovation between our two great nations.”

He further expressed his honour in accompanying Sheikh Hamdan during the visit and added: “Our discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior Indian officials reaffirmed the deep ties between the UAE and India, built on decades of collaboration.”
Ever-expanding demand

As Dubai and India’s aviation ties continue to expand, the demand for travel between the two countries has surged. The DMO has revealed that 538 weekly flights are now operated by six major carriers, connecting Dubai to 23 key Indian destinations. These impressive figures underscore how the aviation partnership between Dubai and India has soared, becoming one of the busiest and most significant air corridors in the world.

India continues to hold its position as the largest destination market for Dubai International Airport (DXB), with 12 million out of a total of 92.3 million passengers travelling between Dubai and India in 2024. This reflects the enduring popularity and demand for air travel between the two nations, driven by their strong economic, cultural, and tourism links.

As the tourism sector booms, DMO said, Dubai welcomed a record 3.14 million visitors from South Asia in 2024, with India contributing the largest share of this influx.

The continued expansion of Dubai’s aviation network is expected to further strengthen bilateral trade, tourism, and business relations between the UAE and India. It will also provide greater connectivity for millions of travellers, reinforcing Dubai's position as a global aviation hub.

Dubai-based banks have cemented their position as major players in the UAE’s banking sector, holding 46 per cent of the country’s total bank deposits, which reached a cumulative balance of Dh1.308 trillion as of January 31, 2025. This reflects a robust annual growth of 13.1 per cent compared to the same period last year, according to the latest figures released by the Central Bank of the UAE.

The data also revealed that total assets of Dubai banks stood at Dh2.025 trillion by the end of January 2025, marking an 11.3 per cent year-on-year increase. The sector’s growing appeal was further demonstrated by a rise in investment balances, which climbed to Dh287 billion — up 11.8per cent from January 2024.

These figures underscore the strong momentum of the UAE’s banking sector, driven by rising deposits, sustained credit activity, and expanding investment portfolios.

AI chip export restrictions 'pulled back' following Mar-a-Lago dinner with Nvidia chief

Shares of chipmaker Nvidia spiked up 18.72% at $114.33 on Wednesday as the Trump administration has reportedly reversed its decision to impose restrictions on Nvidia’s H20 artificial intelligence chip exports to China.

The move came following a private dinner with the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, at Mar-a-Lago last week, NPR reported Wednesday.

Nvidia shares dropped 1.53% to $112.58 in after-hours trading, as investor sentiment has been weighed down by fears of AI market saturation and tighter regulations.

Back on super-billionaire's list

On Thursday (April 10), Huang is back on the super billionaire's list, after a $15.5-billion jump in his wealth to $100.1 billion, as per Forbes' Real-time Billionaires List.

The H20 chip is Nvidia’s most advanced AI processor that can still legally be sold in China under current US export rules.

Plans to tighten those rules had been in motion for months and were nearly finalised, NPR said, citing two sources familiar with the matter.

White House backs off

However, the administration backed off after Nvidia reportedly committed to new US investments in AI data centers.

The White House and Nvidia have not publicly commented on the reversal, as per Reuters.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration signalled intentions to crack down on the export of H20 chips, a policy proposal that actually began under former President Joe Biden.

The shift in stance comes amid mounting pressure from lawmakers — including Republican John Moolenaar and Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi — who in January pushed for tighter controls on AI chip sales to China.

Chip demand up

Chinese demand for Nvidia’s H20 chips has surged in 2024.

ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent, and other tech giants placed orders worth at least $16 billion in the first quarter alone, The Information reported last week. The strong demand is fueled by the rise of cost-efficient AI models from Chinese startup DeepSeek.

Despite this commercial success, Nvidia’s stock has faced turbulence.

Huang, once a major winner in the AI stock boom, has seen his net worth shrink abot $30 billion this year.

He remains the 15th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes.

While down from his $130 billion peak in November, Huang is still far wealthier than he was two years ago, when his net worth hovered around $25 billion.

President Trump’s broader tariff-driven policies have contributed to market volatility, further complicating the landscape for US tech giants navigating the AI arms race with China.

Bloomberg

Dubai’s stock index tumbled on Thursday, poised for its biggest daily decline this year, and other Gulf bourses slid after US president Donald Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs on importers.

Losers outnumbered gainers 34 to 10 on Dubai’s benchmark, which was down as 1.8 per cent, mainly due to Emaar Properties' steep 8.9 per cent drop, while Abu Dhabi’s index slipped 0.8 per cent, signaling a regional downturn.

Saudi Arabia's main index fell 0.4 per cent after Eid, driven by losses from heavyweight firms like Saudi National Bank and oil giant Aramco. Qatar's stock exchange remains closed for the Eid holidays, delaying their market response.

Additionally, a 3 per cent decline in oil prices is adding to the region's financial strain, tied to anxiety over slow economic growth and waning fuel demand.

Analysts and veteran investors reiterated that this is a crucial time for investors to closely monitor these developments, as global trade tensions could affect various sectors. A key focus will be on whether oil prices stabilize or continue to decline, which could influence the region's economic health, they added.

In 2023, the Canadian government announced the expansion of the electronic travel authorisation (eTA) programme to include eligible travellers from 13 additional countries.

It means more people are welcome to come to Canada without visa under changes to the federal programme.

The announcement was made by Sean Fraser, Canada's Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, on June 6, 2023. 

What are the 13 countries?

To qualify under this expanded eTA programme, an eligible traveller must be from one of following:

    Antigua and Barbuda​ 

    Argentina​ 

    Costa Rica 

    Morocco​

    Panama​

    Philippines 

    St. Kitts and Nevis​ 

    St. Lucia 

    St. Vincent and the Grenadines​ 

    Seychelles​ 

    Thailand 

    Trinidad and Tobago​ 

    Uruguay

What is an eTA?

The eTA is a digital travel document that most visa-exempt travellers need to travel to or transit through Canada by air.

The application process is straightforward, requiring the following:

    valid passport,

    credit card,

    email address, and

    internet access. 

What makes one eligible?

Under the expanded programme, passport holders of the 13 countries must:

    Already have a Canadian temporary resident visa in the last 10 years, or 

    Currently hold a valid US non-immigrant visa.

The above conditions allow citizens of the 13 nations to apply for an eTA – instead of a visa – when travelling to Canada by air for business or tourism.

How much is the application fee?

The application fee is CAN$7 (about US$5).

How fast is the approval?

At the time of the announcement, to Fraser said most applications are approved "within minutes".

Benefits

This expansion aims to make travel to Canada faster, easier, and more affordable for thousands of travelers, allowing them to visit for up to six months for business or leisure. 

It is also expected to boost Canada’s economy by facilitating increased travel, tourism, and international business, while strengthening relationships with these countries. 

This measure is also expected to help ease thousands of applications from Canada's visa caseload, enabling more efficient processing of visa applications for all applicants. ​

What about those who are not eligible for eTA?

Those who are not eligible for an eTA, or who are travelling to Canada by means other than air (such as by car, bus, train, or boat—including cruise ships), will still need a visitor visa.

I am visiting the U.S. and I want to come to Canada. Do I need an eTA?

As per the official government website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), most travellers need a visitor visa or an eTA to travel to, or transit through, Canada.

What you need depends on:

    the type of travel document you will travel with;

    the country that issued your travel document;

    your nationality; and

    how you will travel to Canada.

How do I know my eligibility?

Travelers can visit the IRCC website Canada.ca/eTA to determine their eligibility for an eTA and learn how to apply. ​

Canada's recent expansion of the eTA program to include 13 additional countries reflects the country's commitment to facilitating international travel and fostering global connections, while ensuring the safety and efficiency of its immigration processes.

Resilient by design: How NCEMA shapes emergency preparedness in the UAE

NCEMA is a proactive agency whose relevance extends across all levels of governance

The National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority (NCEMA) stands as a cornerstone of the UAE government’s commitment to safeguarding its citizens, residents, and critical assets. Far from being merely a reactive institution, NCEMA is a proactive, strategic agency whose relevance extends across all levels of governance — playing a central role in strengthening national resilience in an increasingly volatile world.

At the core of NCEMA’s mandate is the development and management of a comprehensive national system for emergency, crisis, and disaster response. This system spans the full lifecycle of emergencies: prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Acting as the central coordinating body, NCEMA brings together federal and local government entities, alongside private sector stakeholders, to ensure unified and efficient responses. In a federal system like the UAE, such coordination is crucial to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure agility in crisis scenarios.

NCEMA’s broad remit reflects a holistic approach to national safety. On the prevention and preparedness front, it formulates national strategies, policies, and legislation for emergency management. It conducts rigorous risk assessments to identify threats — ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods to industrial accidents and public health emergencies. Just as crucial are the national training exercises and simulations it oversees, which ensure all relevant stakeholders are equipped and ready to respond effectively.

Mitigation is woven throughout NCEMA’s strategy. This includes identifying vulnerabilities and working to reduce their impact through improved infrastructure, enhanced building codes, and sustained public awareness campaigns.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 tested emergency management capabilities worldwide. In the UAE, it became a defining moment for NCEMA, which rose to the occasion with distinction. From the earliest stages of the outbreak, the agency led a coordinated, whole-of-government response—linking the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Interior, Dubai Health Authority, Abu Dhabi’s Department of Health, and the Armed Forces.

Mass testing sites were deployed with military precision. Quarantine protocols were rapidly standardised and enforced. Strategic public messaging campaigns helped combat misinformation and maintain trust. NCEMA’s central coordination played a key role in the UAE’s world-leading vaccination campaign. While many advanced economies struggled with logistics and coherence, the UAE consistently ranked among the top nations for pandemic response—an achievement attributable in no small part to NCEMA’s foresight and inter-agency collaboration.

NCEMA’s scope extends far beyond public health. In an era of climate disruption, the agency has expanded its focus to address environmental and climate-related threats, such as flash floods, extreme heat, and dust storms. For example, following recent floods in Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah, NCEMA deployed emergency teams in coordination with local authorities and issued real-time evacuation orders and flood alerts via digital platforms and media broadcasts.

In the cybersecurity domain, NCEMA is working behind the scenes to ensure crisis response protocols are ready in the event of disruptions caused by cyberattacks — especially those targeting vital infrastructure in sectors like water, energy, and telecommunications. The agency partners with the UAE’s National Cybersecurity Council to prepare for cascading cyber-physical scenarios, developing specialized protocols to maintain continuity and minimize damage.

Unlike agencies that act only in the aftermath of a crisis, NCEMA’s work is grounded in strategic foresight. It is as much a policy shaper and resilience builder as it is a response coordinator — reflecting the UAE’s investment in institutional resilience as a key component of national security.

The eighth edition of the World Crisis & Emergency Management Summit (WCEMS) 2025, held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, exemplifies this commitment to proactive engagement. Taking place on April 8–9 at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), the summit is more than a regional event — it is a global platform for strategic dialogue and innovation in emergency management.

The theme of “Together Towards Building Global Resilience” highlights the growing understanding that crises are no longer confined within national borders. WCEMS 2025 will convene government leaders, military officials, diplomats, academics, and private sector innovators to share best practices and shape future policy.

Of particular note is the summit’s emphasis on emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence-driven predictive tools to digital platforms for real-time information sharing, the sessions will explore how technological advances can enhance preparedness, response, and recovery. These discussions are not just theoretical — they are meant to inform real-world investments and shape the future of national and international crisis response systems.

The summit serves as a crucial platform for benchmarking national capabilities against international standards and best practices. Policymakers can gain valuable insights into successful strategies implemented by other nations and identify areas for improvement within their own emergency management framework. The high-profile nature of the summit underscores the political commitment to emergency preparedness and resilience, reinforcing its importance within the national agenda of the UAE.

Trump, tariffs and a changing world order

Unpredictability and instability in the US send shockwaves across nations and economies

Traders on the floor of the NYSE as Trump announces new tariffs.
AFP

‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free’ - the iconic words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty have been an abiding promise, a symbol of the great American Dream. In Trump’s America, however, this ethos is being stripped, and unfortunately, what happens in the country does not stay in the country. At the time of writing this, I can only say, fasten your seatbelts!

It is hard to imagine that in the modern era unpredictability and instability are rippling down from the United States to be felt across nations and economies. But here we are under Trump 2.0, shaken and stirred. Twenty-four hours after his call for ‘Liberation Day,’ while the President played golf, there was a bloodbath on global markets. And it was not a one-off incident. The Sensex in India felt the shocks and saw investor wealth of over Rs20 trillion obliterated in seconds. Behind the big numbers is the wiping out of lifetime savings for global investors.

It is no exaggeration, the world is reeling as 60 nations, including India, face Trump’s tariffs. The President claims his actions are a ‘medicine’ to reverse past, unfair trade practices. More likely, it is a bitter pill even for those who signed up to ‘Make America Great Again.’ In this season of rumours, calculations and free-flowing commentary, it is still too early to assess the extent of the implications, but the direction of the wind is not encouraging.
Talk of recession

Saturday Night Live calls it ‘Make America Great Depression Again,’ referring to the 1930s. So, while countries weigh in carefully and take tentative steps (barring China) around the chaos unleashed, the dreaded word ‘recession’ is now beginning to sound like a drumbeat. Goldman Sachs has raised the US recession risk to 45%

In such scenarios, upheaval on the ground cannot be overestimated. It is not just global economies that found their rhythm after the pandemic; citizens who have seen employment and personal income fluctuate during Covid-19 are once again facing uncertainty. Inflation, job loss and a decline in consumer spending are the top-layer repercussions if the scenario unfolds. Peeling the layers will only add to the doom and gloom forecasts.

In Trump’s tumultuous world order, panic and mayhem are coalescing with all of the above even as he tests constitutional boundaries. The question is, what next?
Lives unstable

Ironically, in his promise of MAGA, Trump’s moves have made even the lives of his own voters unstable. Three months since he took over, the honeymoon is over. Protestors across the US took part in rallies against the President and Elon Musk for a ‘hostile takeover.’ Their anger against capitalism and capitulation was also directed at Elon Musk, under whose DOGE department layoffs have reportedly hit the highest since the pandemic. Upending quality of life would hit at the nerve centre of the American Dream.

There is universal fear and uncertainty. Immigrants, living legally in the country, live in apprehension of being arrested or deported in handcuffs, like the hundred Indians who landed home with their feet chained. With 2.8 million people, Indians are among the largest immigrant groups in the US. As things stand, human dignity itself is no longer guaranteed.

Universities, including some of the prestigious Ivy League, have also faced Trump’s measures and seen a slashing of grants for Gaza protests on campus. For the first time in decades, families, especially from other countries, are uncertain about the big league for their children. As scholarships and research funding are tightened, it is no longer just a monetary concern. At the same time, federal funds for health and social security, along with policies, are being phased out as generously as Musk’s tweets on X.

For long, America extended its hand to motley crews of global citizens as they fulfilled their aspirations and found respect and dignity along the way. It is where Silicon Valley wedded ideas to technology and where Hollywood’s glamour was the cherry on top. Even without such lofty standards, the overwhelming feeling is of a nation gone rogue. Fox News quotes US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, “Don’t retaliate, sit back, just take it in. If you retaliate, this will escalate.”
Tensions in the Middle East

While Trump’s decisions are unilateral, his administration naturally parrots the rhetoric. ‘Trump Is Gaslighting Us,’ screams a headline by The Atlantic. This is the same organisation whose editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was mistakenly included on a private group chat on Signal in which high-ranking Trump officials were discussing military strikes in Yemen.

Even as conversations are centred on tariffs, livelihoods and personal liberty, another frontier, a potentially catastrophic one, has been opened. Tensions in the Middle East ratcheted after the American President threatened to bomb Iran if it did not agree to direct negotiations on its nuclear programme. Tehran dismisses the demand as meaningless, and its military is on high alert. A state-run Iranian newspaper has called for Trump’s assassination. While talks on annexing Greenland and Canada are in line with Trump’s go big or go home talk, Iran, with its nuclear arsenal, is not a playground even for the big boys. Gaza has paid an unimaginable human cost; a statesman would look to make sure there is no more.

In this coercive, disruptive order, what is the endgame? “America has always been at war with its darker nature, and sometimes that darker nature wins,” puts forth New York Times columnist David French. There is one clarity. If Trump can slap a 10 percent tariff on the remote Heard and McDonald Islands inhabited only by penguins, nothing and no one is off the table.

Sharjah launches fire safety campaign for industrial areas

New initiative aims to strengthen fire prevention measures and ensure safety compliance

Dubai: The Sharjah City Municipality and Sharjah Civil Defence Authority on Wednesday announced to launch an important safety initiative in a unified effort to enhance fire safety standards across industrial areas

Titled “Industrial Facility Safety is Everyone’s Responsibility,” the campaign seeks to boost awareness among industrial facility owners regarding fire prevention and safety measures, with support from the Sharjah Economic Development Department.

Key objectives

The key objective of this initiative is to ensure strict adherence to fire safety guidelines across industrial zones. The campaign focuses on several critical safety aspects, including proper storage practices, maintaining adequate building setbacks, and ensuring clear, accessible escape routes. Facility owners are reminded that all industrial activities must be licensed and approved by relevant authorities, including fire safety departments.

A cornerstone of the campaign is the emphasis on the regular inspection and upkeep of fire detection and suppression systems. This includes identifying potential internal hazards, establishing clear emergency procedures, and ensuring fire detection systems are linked to Civil Defense operation centres. The initiative calls for the elimination of unsafe practices that could contribute to fire risks.

Common violations

The campaign also addresses common violations observed in industrial facilities. These include unauthorised construction or expansions, the operation of unlicensed high-risk activities, and the use of outdated or ineffective fire safety equipment. Improper or excessive storage of materials and inadequate worker accommodations that fail to meet fire safety standards are also major points of concern.

As part of the roll-out, the campaign is being implemented across all industrial areas, including the Al Saja’a Industrial Area. A critical aspect of the initiative focuses on specific guidelines for buildings lacking integrated fire suppression systems.

These regulations include limitations on storage heights, which must not exceed 3 meters, and require storage to be kept at least one meter below sprinkler systems. Additionally, storage racks must be positioned with a one-meter clearance from structural components, walls, and other racks. Mezzanine floors are restricted to 50% of the ground floor area.

Flammable materials

For facilities dealing with hazardous or flammable materials, the campaign urges the separation of incompatible substances and their storage in fire-resistant areas. Furthermore, the campaign calls for routine maintenance of electrical and mechanical systems by certified technicians, avoiding electrical overloads, and regular cleaning to remove combustible materials.

A crucial part of the initiative is ensuring that escape routes remain unobstructed at all times. The minimum width for these routes is set at 1.2 meters, with at least two clearly marked exits equipped with emergency lighting. Evacuation plans must be prominently displayed throughout the facility.

In addition to promoting these safety measures, the campaign highlights the need for annual servicing and maintenance of fire alarm and detection systems. Facility owners are encouraged to obtain a Fire Prevention Compliance Certificate via the Sharjah Civil Defence Authority’s digital platform, ensuring they meet all required safety standards.

Mumbai: In a move to further deepen Dubai’s economic relations with India, the Dubai International Chamber has opened its second representative office in the country.

Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, who attended the launch of the new office in Bengaluru, said the initiative represents a strategic step that will elevate economic cooperation between Dubai and India.

“It lays the foundation for a new chapter of economic integration, stronger business partnerships, and the development of the digital economy,” Sheikh Hamdan said during an event held by Dubai Chambers in Mumbai, coinciding with his official visit to India.

The Chamber’s first office in India was launched in Mumbai in 2018. With the opening of the Bengaluru office, the number of international representative offices has now risen to 34. This expansion is part of the Dubai Global initiative, launched by Sheikh Hamdan, which aims to establish 50 offices around the world by 2030. The initiative seeks to attract foreign direct investment and support Dubai-based companies in exploring new business opportunities across 30 global markets.
Boosting investments
 

Sheikh Hamdan also met with Piyush Goyal, India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, in Mumbai. The meeting reflected the two nations’ continued efforts to strengthen their strategic economic partnership.

Additionally, in Sheikh Hamdan’s presence, Dubai Chambers held a high-level business meeting in Mumbai, attended by senior officials and business leaders from both sides.

In their addresses at the event, Abdullah bin Touq Al Marri, UAE Minister of Economy, and Minister Goyal highlighted the strength of economic ties between the two nations. They noted that the new office marks a significant step toward expanding cooperation and supporting the ambitious goals of the UAE-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.

Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, Chairman of Dubai Chambers, said that the Mumbai and Bengaluru offices will help accelerate the flow of investments between Dubai and India.

“Dubai International Chamber’s network of international offices plays a vital role in raising awareness among global businesses and investors on the high-potential opportunities Dubai offers across diverse sectors, while also encouraging multinational companies to benefit from the emirate’s competitive and business-friendly environment,” Al Mansoori said.

Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Chairman of Dubai International Chamber, underlined that Dubai’s leadership has long recognised that international trade and deeper connections with global markets are central to the emirate’s future economic growth.

“The Dubai International Chamber plays a vital role in advancing this vision. By strengthening partnerships with key economies such as India, we are not only reinforcing Dubai’s role as a hub for international collaboration but also creating pathways for Emirati businesses to explore new global opportunities,” Sulayem added.

Speeding continues to be a major road safety issue in the UAE, with over 10 million violations recorded in 2024. Authorities have emphasized the dangers of excessive speed, which can lead to fatal accidents.
Speeding continues to be a major road safety issue in the UAE, with over 10 million violations recorded in 2024. Authorities have emphasized the dangers of excessive speed, which can lead to fatal accidents.
Abu Dhabi Police

Dubai: Speeding remains one of the most dangerous driving behaviours on UAE roads, with over 10 million violations recorded in 2024 alone, according to a recent statistic released by the Ministry of Interior (MOI). Authorities have repeatedly warned that excessive speed is a leading cause of deadly accidents, such as vehicle rollovers, run-overs, rear-end collisions, and vehicles veering off the road.

To avoid risking your life and the lives of others, the most effective measure is to follow posted speed limits, avoid sudden lane changes, and eliminate distractions while driving. To help you stay safe and avoid fines, here are the latest updates on speed limits across the UAE.

Speeding fines in the UAE

Despite strict enforcement, speeding continues to be a widespread issue. The UAE imposes heavy penalties for drivers who exceed speed limits:

    Exceeding by over 80km/h: Dh3,000 fine, 23 black points, and 60-day vehicle impoundment

    Exceeding by over 60km/h: Dh2,000 fine, 12 black points, and 30-day vehicle impoundment

    Exceeding by up to 60km/h: Dh1,500 fine, 6 black points, and 15-day vehicle impoundment

1. Speed limits reduced on major roads in Abu Dhabi

Abu Dhabi Mobility announced two key changes that take effect from April 14, 2025. The speed limit on Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed International Road (E11) will drop from 160km/h to 140km/h, while the limit on Abu Dhabi–Sweihan Road (E20) will reduce from 120km/h to 100km/h. These updates were shared by the authority on its official X (formerly Twitter) account.
2. Slow drivers face fines on Abu Dhabi’s fast lanes

Additionally, a minimum speed limit is enforced on Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Road, but only on the two leftmost lanes. Drivers using these lanes must travel at no less than 120km/h and no more than 140km/h. Failure to meet the minimum speed could lead to a Dh400 fine. Authorities have stressed that minimum speed signs are in place on many highways to reduce hazards caused by slow-moving vehicles.
3. Red road markings highlight revised speed limits in Abu Dhabi

In 2024, Abu Dhabi City Municipality also introduced new red pavement markings to make revised speed limits more visible to drivers. Among the updated roads are:

    Abu Dhabi–Al Ain Road (E-22) near Sas Al Nakhl, where the limit dropped from 120km/h to 100km/h.

    Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Street (E-311) near Sweihan Bridge, reduced from 140km/h to 120km/h.

    The same road near Baniyas Cemetery, where it decreased from 120km/h to 100km/h.

    Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Street (E-10) near Sheikh Zayed Bridge, lowered from 120km/h to 100km/h.

    Sections of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Road (E-12) between Jubail Island and Saadiyat, and on Saadiyat Island itself, with limits reduced from 140km/h and 120km/h to 120km/h and 100km/h, respectively.

The speed on Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan Al Nahyan Street was increased to 100km/h between Dubai Al Ain Road and the Academic City Roundabout. However, from the roundabout to Al Khawaneej Street, the maximum speed was adjusted to 90km/h.

Al Amardi Street also saw changes, with the speed limit standardised to 90km/h between Al Khawaneej Street and Emirates Road. RTA updated signage and road markings to reflect the new limits.

Ras Al Khaimah also introduced a speed limit change earlier this year. Since January 17, 2025, Sheikh Mohammed bin Salem Street - stretching from Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Roundabout (Al Rafaa) to Al Marjan Island Roundabout—has had its speed limit reduced from 100km/h to 80km/h. The road is a key route through several residential, commercial, and tourist areas, including Al Rifaa, Al Jazira Al Hamra, and Mina Al Arab.

In 2024, Ras Al Khaimah Police announced a speed limit change on Al Watan Road. The speed limit was increased from 100km/h to 120km/h to improve traffic flow.

Sharjah is exploring ways to minimise fire mishaps and disasters by deploying advanced technologies in buildings in the emirate. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be key in making structures more resilient to such risks.

Research is being carried out in the American University of Sharjah with help from local and international educators and governmental entities to deploy AI to prevent such mishaps.

Findings will be used to implement structure advancements across the emirate, Sharjah Civil Defence Authority said on Wednesday. As part of this effort, the University's College of Engineering has organised a two-day fire safety symposium in collaboration with the civil defence authority.

Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.

Director of Protection & Safety Department Lieutenant Colonel Dr Hamad Abdul Karim Al Mazmi told Khaleej Times that the symposium will act as the first step in this project, which will likely yield results by the end of this year. He added that though there are series of steps to be taken before the end result, it is possible that buildings will have advanced technologies by next year. 

It was not immediately clear how Sharjah would use these technologies. A fire chief from San Bernardino California explained how his department uses AI as decision-making and support tools as well as using drones as “first responders”. 

Addressing the symposium, Dan Munsey said that artificial intelligence may also be used for preventing fires by predicting where the next natural disaster will be.

Discussions in the symposium revolved around artificial intelligence, robotics, fire safety and engineering. Dr. Rami Hawileh, Professor of Civil Engineering at the American University of Sharjah, said that fires are typically a secondary cause during natural disasters, such as earthquakes, but their effects are much more dire. 

The university also launched a minor programme dedicated to safety and fire protection last year to help mitigate risks when it comes to fires, which Hawileh said are a “major problem.”

Still, he said that “in the end, every single person is responsible in the event of a fire,” and that these talks and workshops will aim to educate the general public. 

With the help of local and international research academics, government entities, and private entities, the symposium delved into a series of talks and workshops that will aid in the conversation of fire safety. “[The university] is bringing speakers from all over the world and the audience is also coming from different places. We might be receiving more than 150 delegates,” he said. 

The emirate’s municipality has taken measures to address fire safety in residential and commercial buildings. In 2023, Sharjah announced a Dh100 million project that will replace the external faces of buildings, known as facades, with fire-resistant material. So far, five buildings have been fire-proofed, with a target of 40 buildings in total.

Sheikh Hamdan in India: We have been waiting for you, says minister

An Indian minister has hailed Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s visit, calling it “symbolic” in strengthening generations of cooperation.

Addressing Sheikh Hamdan and the UAE delegation in Mumbai on Tuesday, at a special event organised by the Dubai Chambers, India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal welcomed him warmly, calling him “someone we have been waiting for, for a long time.”

“Thank you very much for your gracious presence in my home city,” he said. “We are welcoming today a youth icon, Fazza (name under which Sheikh Hamdan publishes his poetry). He is a man with a heart of gold and always the first to be of help to anybody who needs it."

Earlier in the day, Sheikh Hamdan and Goyal discussed advancing cooperation across various sectors, including trade, energy, investment, manufacturing, logistics, technology and healthcare.

Sheikh Hamdan said, "India and the UAE share more than strong economic ties; we share a bold vision for the future. Our partnership is built on trust, innovation, and a common commitment to shaping resilient, forward-looking economies that advance prosperity and enhance the welfare of the people of the two countries.

"As we deepen our cooperation across a range of vital sectors, we are not only unlocking new opportunities for growth, innovation and excellence, but also creating a distinctive model of bilateral collaboration."

'A historic connect'

Goyal also noted that the timing of Sheikh Hamdan’s visit was very "symbolic" in strengthening “a big historic connect” between the two markets. “There is a generational continuance,” he said. “This is the fourth generation of his family who is visiting [the country]. This is the 100th year anniversary of the visit of Sheikh Saeed (the great-grandfather of Sheikh Hamdan) to India.”

On Tuesday, Sheikh Hamdan arrived in New Delhi on his first official trip to India at invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In talks held during his two-day visit, both countries explored ways to build on the momentum generated by the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) and the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).

On the sidelines of the visit, Dubai Chambers held a Dubai-Indian business forum which connected over 200 entrepreneurs and decision makers from both countries to explore opportunities of mutual cooperation and trade. Vice Chairman of the entity Ahmed bin Byat said Sheikh Hamdan’s visit was a beginning. “I am sure this will not be his last visit,” he said. “We will continue to grow this relationship that we cherish.”

Non-oil trade between the UAE and India grew by 20.5 percent in 2024, reaching more than Dh240 billion, compared to Dh199.3 billion in 2023. This significant growth reflects strengthening economic ties and promising trade and investment opportunities. The UAE-India CEPA, signed in 2022, aims to aim to take non-oil trade to $100 billion by 2030.
 'Right environment'

Several UAE-based Indian businessmen hailed the visit, with one saying it was creating the “right environment” for companies. “The fact that this meeting is happening at the leadership level of both counties is extremely encouraging for creating the right investment environment,” said tech billionaire Div Turakhia. “Both countries can mutually benefit from each other in various ways. For Indian companies, Dubai is the gateway to access the entire world.”

Emirati businessman Essa Abdulla Ahmad Al Ghurair was part of the Dubai delegation which included 39 prominent entrepreneurs from the UAE. He called the visit and the conference “a journey” in expanding ties and said that his company will be looking to expand its business interested in India.

UAE: Pakistanis can now avail 5-year multiple-entry visas

Pakistanis can now avail of a five-year multiple-entry tourist visa after the resolution of existing issues, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al Zaabi announced on Tuesday.

According to Dubai’s General Directorate of Identity and Foreigners Affairs website, the UAE issues multiple-entry tourist visas for five years. The visa allows a person to make several trips to the UAE from the date of issue, without needing a guarantor or a host within the country.

The development came during a meeting between Zaabi and Sindh Governor Karmran Khan Tessori at the Governor’s House, a Dawn report said.

Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.

"Visa issues have been resolved; Pakistanis can get a five-year visa,” Zaabi said in a press release from the Governor House. He also invited the governor to visit the visa centre at the Karachi consulate.

Tessori thanked the UAE diplomat for his country’s investment in the province, especially in Karachi. The ambassador praised ongoing projects under the governor’s initiative, the report said.

According to reports, the UAE authorities have lately increased the scrutiny of Pakistanis arriving in the country due to their alleged involvement in crime and unlawful activities, like begging. On December 23, a Senate panel was informed that all Pakistani travellers to the UAE needed to be vetted and verified by the police. Travel agents were also instructed in this regard.

In another meeting on January 9, the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development was told that there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the UAE. It further learnt that visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed” and its government had reservations that Pakistanis, on visit visas, resort to begging in the country, Dawn said in its report.

On the other hand, during an interview with Geo News in November last year, the Consul-General of UAE in Karachi, Dr Bakheet Ateeq Alremeithi, revealed that Pakistanis may be facing visa rejections due to negative social media activities.

Alremeithi also stated that there had been complaints regarding the conduct of certain Pakistani social media influencers in the UAE, especially on platforms such as TikTok, resulting in dissatisfaction from the UAE government and prompting stricter visa regulations that have raised concerns for Pakistani travellers. He also clarified that there was no ban on UAE visas for Pakistani nationals.

The travel and tourism industry is expected to create one in every eight jobs, with over 460 million new positions over the next decade.

This was shared by Julia Simpson, President & CEO of the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), during a virtual meeting held from Brussels.

The WTTC unveiled its 2025 Economic Impact Report on Wednesday in collaboration with Oxford Economics, highlighting fresh insights into global travel trends and industry growth projections.

Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.

“In terms of employment, we forecast the sector to support a staggering 460 million jobs in 2035 that's roughly one in every eight jobs globally,” said Simpson.

According to an earlier report from Emirates Group and Dubai Airports, Dubai's aviation industry is expected to create an additional 185,000 jobs over the next five years.

This indicated that the hiring surge in Dubai's airlines and aviation sector, which began in late 2021 after the peak of the Covid-19 will continue. During this time, recruitment for new pilots, cabin crew, and ground staff reached unprecedented levels as travel resumed.

Etihad Airways, the national airline of the UAE, is also poised to hire hundreds of additional pilots to support its growing fleet and network, along with recruiting for other positions.
UAE, Dubai's significant contribution

Meanwhile, as per the latest WTTC report, the travel industry in the Middle East — particularly in Dubai and the UAE — has already added $342 billion to the world’s GDP in 2024, underscoring its impressive growth and strong potential for further expansion.

Responding to a question from Khaleej Times, Simpson added, “Dubai airport, is so successful because it's able to keep recreating itself. It's being recording record numbers at the moment, and the Middle East is going to be one of the regions that we are going to be talking.” It’s worth noting that the significant growth in employment and visitor spending reflects the UAE's strategic vision and dedication to advancing its travel and tourism sector. “It is one of the most successful regions that we're seeing, it is galloping ahead. Dubai is doing very well.”

Shedding light on global projections, she added, “Last year, we witnessed record breaking numbers, and our forecast this year suggests that this year we are going to be registering positive growth, and that is set to continue. In fact, we expect the sector to contribute a record breaking $11.7 trillion to the global GDP.”

Markedly, this is a 7.34 percent up from $10.9 trillion in 2024.
Travel trends

Simpson also emphasised that business travel has rebounded a full year ahead of projections, with conference halls filling up and deal‑makers back in the skies.

“Business travel came back a year earlier than we thought it did. So, we're seeing a lot of conferences, a lot of people going to do deals. Even in troubled times like this, there will be people flying around trying to do deals. Business travel's strong, and it's recovered well.”

The next trend she highlighted was the luxury end. “We're seeing that there's big interest in well-being. Now the big name of the game is longevity.”

Additionally she reflected on the importance of nature. “Nature, I think, is really important. We are still seeing people who want to get off the beaten track, even though it started post-pandemic, but people have continued that trend. People want to be alongside nature, and when I say nature, they want to be alongside local people and local customs. We’re seeing that a lot -- that quest for authenticity.

We’re also seeing trends in three generations traveling together. Now it's very popular and we’re also seeing the rise of the single, over-64-year-old woman traveling alone as well, which is a big trend.”

UAE: Why Gen Z is choosing lower salaries for more flexibility

According to a recent survey by an online CV-maker company, about 55 per cent of Gen Z respondents in the UK said they would accept lower pay in exchange for remote work

A recent survey by an online CV-maker company has revealed an intriguing shift in employment preferences, particularly among Gen Z. In the UK, about 55 per cent of Gen Z respondents said they would accept a lower salary in exchange for remote work.

According to CV Genius, this trend is now making waves beyond UK, with the UAE becoming a focal point for this evolving work culture. As businesses in the country adapt to new demands, one thing is clear: The traditional approach to work is rapidly changing, and Gen Z is leading the charge.

Nikhil Nanda, director at Dubai-based Innovations Group, shared with Khaleej Times his insights into how the UAE’s workforce is adapting to these changes.

Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.

"With each new generation, we see a shift in priorities. Gen Z, on average, comes from more financially stable households than previous generations, meaning their career decisions are less driven by an immediate need for higher salaries. Instead, they place greater value on work-life balance, flexibility, and job satisfaction,” he said. 

Nanda explained that for this new generation, career choices aren’t about immediate financial gain. Many Gen Z employees value the ability to manage their time, pursue personal projects, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

"They recognise that a supportive work environment allows them the time and stability to pursue additional income streams through investments, side projects, or creative endeavours," he added.

Flexible work models

This shift has led to a growing interest in flexible work models. Remote work, once seen as a luxury or a perk, is increasingly becoming a priority for employees in the UAE, especially for those in roles that don’t require constant in-person collaboration.

"Companies that understand and adapt to these evolving expectations will have a competitive advantage in attracting top Gen Z talent,” he shared.

The trend towards remote work has also been influenced by practical considerations, such as the rising costs associated with commuting in the UAE.

"Dubai’s traffic congestion has reached unprecedented levels. The added financial burden of Salik tolls further exacerbates this issue, prompting many employees to seek alternatives that offer more flexibility and reduce the strain of daily travel," Nanda noted.

In response to these challenges, many companies are already factoring remote work into their compensation strategies. 

"While not all companies have adopted or formalised lower-salary-for-remote-work models, many are recalibrating their remuneration strategies to reflect the cost savings and productivity advantages that come with flexible work arrangements. This trend is highly industry-dependent, with some sectors more suited to remote work than others,” Nanda added.
‘It’s about enhancing productivity’

Ali Sharif, CEO and managing director of ProGlobal, noted remote work is about enhancing productivity and work-life balance.

“We focus on the value of time saved — employees commuting from far-off places or other emirates save up to 40 hours a month, which they can reinvest into their work and personal lives,” said Sharif.

“We highlight the financial benefits of remote work, such as saving on fuel and commuting costs, effectively increasing their take-home value. We believe remote work empowers our team, making them more productive without compromising their income.

"Additionally, we maintain connection with in-office days every Monday for collaboration and bonding," he added.

Looking ahead, Nanda predicted that hybrid models will become more widespread across the UAE. These models offer a structured form of flexibility, where remote work is strategically applied to roles that benefit from it, while still maintaining in-office presence for jobs requiring collaboration or on-site oversight.

"Remote work is not a one-size-fits-all proposition; it is a tool to be optimised," Nanda explained.
Innovating workplaces

Gen Z, with their digital fluency and demand for autonomy, will be central in pushing businesses to innovate workplace structures.

"Companies that proactively embrace this shift, rather than resist it, will set themselves apart as forward-thinking employers of choice," Nanda emphasised.

The UAE’s labour market is likely to experience significant transformation in the coming years.

"The government has already introduced many innovative labour policies, visa programmes, and legal frameworks to facilitate flexible working arrangements while maintaining regulatory oversight. These measures will help ensure that as remote work expands, it remains secure, structured, and compliant,” he explained.

Nanda pointed out: "Over the next few years, we can expect companies to formalise hybrid work models with clear policies governing remote employment. Businesses that embrace these changes will benefit from access to a wider talent pool, higher retention rates, and improved operational efficiency.

“However, companies that lag behind in adapting to these evolving dynamics may struggle to attract and retain top talent in an increasingly competitive market,” he added.

UAE: How will Trump's tariffs impact remittances?

Last week, US President Donald Trump announced 10 per cent baseline tariff on all imports to the US and higher duties on several countries

An expert pointed out that with growing concerns about a weakening dollar, many could choose to send their savings back home earlier than planned.

"Now more than ever, UAE residents need access to instant remittance services to manage their money," said Mohammad El Saadi, VP of Careem Pay. "The proposed tariffs could trigger broader economic uncertainty and put downwards pressure on the US-dollar pegged dirhams."

Last week, US President Donald Trump announced 10 per cent baseline tariff on all imports to the US and higher duties on several countries — a move that sent global stock markets plummeting, with the danger of a trade war looming. China retaliated with a 83 per cent increase in taxes on American imports and Trump has threatened to hit back with additional tariffs.

Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.
Varying impact

El Saadi noted that the impact on remittances would vary depending on the income bracket of the UAE residents. "While lower-income expats in the country are likely to maintain their usual remittance patterns to support their families back home, middle and higher-income earners may start shifting more of their savings out of the UAE in anticipation of a weaker dollar."

He added that some may even choose to send money abroad for investments "to take advantage of market dips" and that this could cause a "short-term spike" in remittances as people looked to protect the value of their money.

Meanwhile, Adeeb Ahamed, Managing Director of Lulu Financial Holdings noted that although there won't be a major impact on remittances, people will be more mindful about sending their money back home in the face of the tariffs. "Cost of living is expected to increase across some impacted products," he said. "UAE being an import country, it relies on other countries to bring in needed items. So some products which pass through the US in the supply chain could see price increases.”
Trends

According to El Saadi, Careem Pay saw the strongest remittances growth in Pakistan, India, Europe, and UK in March. India remained the top corridor by transfer volumes contributing over two-thirds of its total international money transfers.

"January saw a spike in high-value transfers and average remittances per user as favorable exchange rates prompted users to send more money home," he said. "However, some customers have held back transfers due to a decline in the Indian stock market."

On Tuesday, Ahamed had noted that there was a significant shift in the reasons why Indian expats sent money home. He said that now, more people were remitting to invest in the stock market and create a passive income, as opposed to home maintenance, which had been the norm for the last few decades.

UAE traffic law: Reckless drivers to be arrested on the spot, fines increased

UAE introdocues new measures to combat reckless driving and enhance road safety

UAE Ministry of Interior warns of hefty fines for reckless driving

Abu Dhabi: Reckless drivers can now be arrested on the spot and will face hefty fine of up to Dh100,000, according to the revised traffic regulations in the UAE.

Recent updates to the UAE’s traffic laws are designed to address the growing concerns about road safety, with specific emphasis on curbing reckless driving, according to the Ministry of Interior.

The new measures, which came into effect at the end of March, grant traffic enforcement officers greater authority, including the power to arrest drivers caught in the act of committing dangerous offences. These amendments also introduced harsher penalties for violators, reinforcing the government’s commitment to reducing road-related injuries and fatalities.

Major amendments

According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Interior, UAE traffic departments recorded 4,291 violations in 2024 for “driving in a manner that endangers life and safety.” These violations were spread across the country, with the highest number of incidents in Dubai (2,765 violations), followed by significant occurrences in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and other emirates.

Disturbing trend

The statistics also revealed a disturbing trend of reckless driving involving heavy vehicles, with 96 violations reported for actions that endangered both driver and public safety. To tackle these dangerous behaviours, Abu Dhabi Police, in collaboration with the Monitoring and Control Center, launched a new initiative called “Your Comment,” sharing footage of traffic incidents caused by reckless driving to raise awareness.

Six key offences

Under the newly amended traffic law, traffic enforcement officers and police are authorised to arrest drivers on the spot for any of the following six offences:

    Causing death or injury while driving

    Causing significant property damage due to reckless driving

    Engaging in reckless driving that endangers public safety

    Driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any impairing substance

    Refusing to provide identification or providing false information

    Fleeing the scene of an accident, disobeying an officer’s order, or initiating a police pursuit

Stricter penalties

As part of the reform, drivers found guilty of causing death due to negligent driving now face severe penalties, including imprisonment and/or a fine of no less than Dh50,000. If the fatal incident was caused by running a red light, driving under the influence, driving with a revoked license, or crossing a flooded wadi, the penalties are even more stringent: a minimum of one year in prison and a fine of at least Dh100,000.

In addition, violators who engage in reckless driving that leads to accidents or harm will face fines of up to Dh2,000, along with 23 black points, and the impoundment of their vehicle for 60 days. If the impoundment release fee of Dh50,000 is not paid within three months, the vehicle may be auctioned off.

Four essential obligations for drivers

The new law also outlines four primary duties that all drivers must adhere to in order to ensure public safety.

    Follow the instructions of traffic authorities, especially during emergencies, such as heavy rainfall or flooding.

    Slow down near schools, hospitals, and busy areas, and adhere to speed limits indicated by traffic signs.

    Reduce speed in areas with limited visibility, or when the road is obstructed by physical barriers or animals.

    Stop completely at pedestrian crossings until pedestrians have safely crossed.

Penalties for fleeing the scene of an accident

A crucial update in the law stipulates severe consequences for those who flee the scene of an accident.

Offenders can face up to one year in prison and/or a fine between Dh50,000 and Dh100,000 for the following offences:

    Failing to stop after a traffic accident-causing injury

    Refusing to provide identifying information to help resolve the accident

    Fleeing from police officers or causing a pursuit

    Colliding intentionally with enforcement, military, or security vehicles during official duties

China limits Hollywood films as trade war escalates to services

Authorities vowed to 'moderately reduce' the number of US movies allowed into the country

China announced it would curb imports of Hollywood films, opening a new front in its trade war with the US hours after President Donald Trump’s record tariffs took effect.

Authorities vowed to “moderately reduce” the number of US movies allowed into the world’s second-largest economy in a Thursday statement — a step floated earlier this week as a possible retaliation measure by two influential Chinese bloggers. 

“The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience’s favorability toward American films,” the China Film Administration said, announcing the move.

Shares of entertainment companies including Walt Disney Co., Paramount Global and Warner Bros Discovery Inc. were down in pre-market trading as part of a broader pullback in markets.

While President Xi Jinping’s government held off from an outright ban of US films, the move signaled Beijing could now target American services in the trade war. That opens up a new menu of retaliation options: The US runs a service trade surplus with China, mainly in travel, intellectual property royalties and transportation.

A state-media affiliated account, which has been used to signal Beijing’s stance on trade issues, this week cited an expert saying China doesn’t rule out targeting services.  

“China has plenty of tools for retaliation,” the article on Yuyuantantian’s social media page said. “Of course, China will widely listen to opinion and minimize the negative impact on the domestic economy while trying to maximize the effect of countermeasures.”

Tensions between Beijing and Washington have spiraled beyond tit-for-tat tariff exchanges in recent days to also impact people ties. Chinese officials Wednesday cautioned citizens against traveling to the US, and warned students of security risks related to studying in “certain US states” — a departure from Xi’s push to improve people exchanges. 
Smaller market

China was long a crucial market for US studios. After the first US picture was approved for release in the Asian nation in 1994, studios grew a dependence on that market for growth as the box office peaked in the West and streaming stole audiences. But in recent years, Chinese regulators have curbed access to their theaters, suggesting American titles don’t align with Communist Party values.

The number of approved US releases in China peaked at more than 60 in 2018 but has declined through 2021, according to data from the Chinese ticketing service Maoyan Entertainment. Both escalating trade and political tensions between the US and China and the popularity of local-language films in China have been headwinds for American film releases in the Asian nation.

Case in point: Deadpool & Wolverine opened at No. 1 in most countries in July. It opened at No. 2 in China, where the top grossing movie that weekend was the Chinese comedy Successor. After years of embracing Hollywood movies, the vast majority of China’s box office has been coming from homegrown pictures.

Recently film fans in the Asian nation have been raving about Ne Zha 2, a domestically made animated movie about a rebellious child fighting off monsters straight out of Chinese mythology. 

Policymakers’ push to boost domestic consumption, however, had sparked renewed optimism that Hollywood blockbusters may once again secure more screen time in the country.

It means more people are welcome to come to Canada without visa under changes to the federal programme.

The announcement was made by Sean Fraser, Canada's Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, on June 6, 2023. 

What are the 13 countries?

To qualify under this expanded eTA programme, an eligible traveller must be from one of following:

    Antigua and Barbuda​ 

    Argentina​ 

    Costa Rica 

    Morocco​

    Panama​

    Philippines 

    St. Kitts and Nevis​ 

    St. Lucia 

    St. Vincent and the Grenadines​ 

    Seychelles​ 

    Thailand 

    Trinidad and Tobago​ 

    Uruguay

What is an eTA?

The eTA is a digital travel document that most visa-exempt travellers need to travel to or transit through Canada by air.

The application process is straightforward, requiring the following:

    valid passport,

    credit card,

    email address, and

    internet access. 

What makes one eligible?

Under the expanded programme, passport holders of the 13 countries must:

    Already have a Canadian temporary resident visa in the last 10 years, or 

    Currently hold a valid US non-immigrant visa.

The above conditions allow citizens of the 13 nations to apply for an eTA – instead of a visa – when travelling to Canada by air for business or tourism.

How much is the application fee?

The application fee is CAN$7 (about US$5).

How fast is the approval?

At the time of the announcement, to Fraser said most applications are approved "within minutes".

Benefits

This expansion aims to make travel to Canada faster, easier, and more affordable for thousands of travelers, allowing them to visit for up to six months for business or leisure. 

It is also expected to boost Canada’s economy by facilitating increased travel, tourism, and international business, while strengthening relationships with these countries. 

This measure is also expected to help ease thousands of applications from Canada's visa caseload, enabling more efficient processing of visa applications for all applicants. ​

What about those who are not eligible for eTA?

Those who are not eligible for an eTA, or who are travelling to Canada by means other than air (such as by car, bus, train, or boat—including cruise ships), will still need a visitor visa.

I am visiting the U.S. and I want to come to Canada. Do I need an eTA?

As per the official government website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), most travellers need a visitor visa or an eTA to travel to, or transit through, Canada.

What you need depends on:

    the type of travel document you will travel with;

    the country that issued your travel document;

    your nationality; and

    how you will travel to Canada.

How do I know my eligibility?

Travelers can visit the IRCC website Canada.ca/eTA to determine their eligibility for an eTA and learn how to apply. ​

Canada's recent expansion of the eTA program to include 13 additional countries reflects the country's commitment to facilitating international travel and fostering global connections, while ensuring the safety and efficiency of its immigration processes.
